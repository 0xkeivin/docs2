- Proof of stake
- You can produce blocks and receive block rewards based on your % of the MINA staked on the network.
Any user with any amount of MINA can receive these rewards--i.e. no minimum.
- No slashing.
- You must activately choose to stake to receive rewards, either by delegating or running a block producer. (not staking by default). If you have a low amount of MINA, itâ€™s recommended that you delegate to receive rewards, to avoid costs of running a node.
- Choose a staking pool operator that you trust b/c staking does not occur on chain. (link to Stake Tab to help people find ones they trust).
It takes ~1mo for your delegation to become active (before you start earning rewards for the delegation)- Show Epoch calculator tool? (can the community build this?)
- Give formula (given % of stake, this is the % of block rewards that you would get).
