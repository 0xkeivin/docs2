## What are zkApps?

zkApps (“snark apps”) are Mina’s zk-SNARK-powered smart contracts.

zkApps use an off-chain execution and mostly off-chain state model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public. Using the power of [zk-SNARKs](../mina-glossary#zk-snark), smart contracts can perform arbitrarily complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting [zero-knowledge proof](../mina-glossary#zero-knowledge-proof) to the chain, as opposed to other blockchains which use a gas-fee based model.

You can learn more about [How zkApps Work](./how-zkApps-work) on the next page.

## TypeScript

zkApps are written in TypeScript. 

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type-safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps.
