# Grants & Programs
Apply for grants and programs in the Mina ecosystem


The Mina community offers various programs to promote growth of the Mina ecosystem.
zkApps Builders Program
O(1) Labs, a Mina ecosystem partner, created and runs the zkApps Builders Program (ZBP), a 12-week, online program to support developers who are interested in building zkApps-related projects.
The goal of the program is to provide direct access to the O(1) Labs team to support developers as they build their zkApp project and to gather feedback for improving SnarkyJS and zkApps. You can read more about the projects that came out of ZBP cohort 1 (Spring 2022) here.
ZBP cohort 2 (Fall 2022) applications are now closed.
Sign up to get notified when ZBP cohort 3 applications open.
